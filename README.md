# Alien-Invaders-ThreeJS

Simple 2.5 D Space Invaders inspired game made using ThreeJS.

Game is playable, but due to lack of some textures I would rather call it the "prototype" for the time being...

To run it you need:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- [Live Server Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
